This is my second public repository on github.

These are the first GUI projects that I made in Python3.
I had completed 63% of the bootcamp in Python3 on udemy when i started uploading these on 15/02/21.
I had finished all the projects in this section (last section) of the course on 25/02/21 and uploaded them on the next day.

You need to have Python3 installed to play these games.
